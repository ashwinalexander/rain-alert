* The original goal was to follow the Python Day 35 lesson and build a bot that will alert 
a user if it will rain in the future.
* The OpenWeatherMap API has changed since when this course was created and we can no longer do the 
above for free. 
* So, instead of using the OneCall endpoint, we will use the weather endpoint to get current weather data
* This bot will alert users WHEN it rains and not ahead of time.
